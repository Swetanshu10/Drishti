Developed the blind person app which retrieves location coordinates using geolocation api and store this data in firebase which is then read in the my-app and the location marker is shown on map using leaflet.js library based on retrived coordinates. The my-app has feature to control when the location should be shared and when not

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is a smart physical assistant for blind persons, under this project, we are developing a smart stick with sensors,camera, button and microcontrollers to help blind person safely navigate, this is a companion web
application which would be used by family members/friends of the blind person. 
The application will notify users about the emergency/SOS message whenever the blind person will press the emergency button and show entire history of messages with the help of cloud database

# My Role
I collaborated with other UI Developer in my team to develop this application, My task was to populate the user interface with data retrieved from firebase database and add functionality to components like button 
and links. I worked with React, react-hooks , react-router and firebase to fetch and send data, update state and display it on user interface and route components. I also used web apis to build notification feature in this application and geolocation api for location tracking
